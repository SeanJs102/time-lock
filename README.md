I focused on the scheduling transaction functionality, that let users create transactionsâ€™
schedules with particular parameters. Furthermore, I added a functionality to display all the
queued transactions and their information including their detail based on event emitters and a
mapping in the Timelock smart contract for holding information of both queued and unqueued
transactions. Apart from that, I also use the filter function on queued transactions such as
filter by status or time.
